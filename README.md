# autohotkey-german-programmer-layer

Because a lot of characters on the German keyboard are not very well accessible. If you program Javascript or C++ this is a handycap.

The script adds two layers to the keyboard.
One layer is for easy access those characters which needed all the time for programming.
The other layer controls the cursor like the sofware TouchCursor.

Both scripts are adapted to German keyboards But they can easily adapted to other keboards or your own needs.


The following layer can be activated be holding Caps Lock or # down. The normal functionality of Caps Lock and the  key is deactivated!

The following layer can be activated be holding Space down. If you press the Space key short, a Space charackter is printed. If you want a continous printing of Space
you have to hold down Space and press S.
